# Headless Tablet

The purpose of this project is to modernize some of the older existing pages on the tablet site that are currently static HTML pages, by recreating them in React, with a WP back end. The reason for this update is to ensure that the older pages can now, and will continue, to work in tandem with the rest of the Tablet site.
